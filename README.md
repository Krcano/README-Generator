  ## Description
  My Project is a uses Node.js to create an easy-to-use template for a professional readme.md file. It asks for the user's project information using inquirer prompts and takes the information provided to create the readme. Through this project I have become more comfortable with the process of grabbing data from one function and using it another to accomplish a purpose. It also taught me about module exports and how information from one file can be exported to a different file.
